Note: some of these were originally made by InnocentSam, I just optimized them a bit.
      In fact, all of them are optimized to the point where it's pretty painful to make
      changes to them.

FOR room009:

To get the light to flicker, change the light's color to black (0 0 0) instead of removing
it or changing it's intensity, otherwise you will end up changing the layout of the lightmap
which must be the same for both states.

FOR medibay:

Add all of the models that start with "med" and the microscope manually if they're not there.
Center all of them at the origin, they're already offset.

FOR room038:

You might want to replace the tree.
